Repository for Module 15 Challenge
## In this challenge, we utilized data from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS, to provide information about recent earthquake data.  The included map shows all earthquake data from the last 7 days.  The color of each marker is dependent on the earthquake's depth (the darker the color, the greater the depth), while the size of the marker is dependent on the earthquake's magnitude (the larger the marker, the greater the magnitude).
